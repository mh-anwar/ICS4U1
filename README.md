# ICS 4U1
All of my Java assignments from ICS 4U1 (Grade 12 Computer Science) as well as my Independent Study Unit.


All of these folders were downloaded from Replit using a Replit tool built for this: [ReplitManager](https://github.com/mh-anwar/ReplitManager) and committed with their respective last modified date. The only changes made were the deletion of any `.git`, `.cache` directories or `.log` and error files.

## File Naming Scheme
The first digit of each file such as `56` is the Unit Number and the second digit is the Lesson Number, meanign this would be Unit 5 Lesson 6. Any third digit is a subtask within that lesson. Other than that example files are contain `Ex` or `Example` and activity files contain `Act` or `Activity`.
